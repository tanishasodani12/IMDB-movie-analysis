## ✅ What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset using Power Query.
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values using median and "Unknown".
- Split movies with multiple genres into separate records for accurate analysis.
- Performed descriptive analysis (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation).
- Created Pivot Tables to compare ratings across:
  - Genres
  - Directors
  - Languages
- Calculated correlation between **Budget** and **Gross Earnings**.
- Calculated **Profit Margin** to evaluate commercial success.
- Created visual charts (scatter, summary graphs, pivot charts).
- Presented insights in PowerPoint backed with a live Excel breakdown.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting)
- **Statistical Functions** (AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV, CORREL, PERCENTILE)
- **Visualization** (Scatter plots, summary charts)
- **Data Interpretation & Insight building**

## 📊 Key Results & Insights
- **Film-Noir and Biography** genres had the **highest average ratings**.

- **Strong direction and storytelling** outperform expensive production.
- Smaller, regional films can outperform mainstream films when content is strong.
